The client was The Gaming Room, and they hada a game called draw it or lose it that they wanted to turn into a multi-platform game. This document was very helpful to focus on the task at hand and organizing all the considerations 
to be taken into consideration for the client to and others charged with designing the game if any. If I could choose one part to improve it would maybe that I could've expressed the design constraints a bit more per different platforms
instead of being to general with it. I looked at the needs that where listed in the request and I kept my research specific to the requests and what all it would take to accomplish a game designed like that. 
I spent more time documenting the design in the most clear way possible with some time updating a given code for the games functionality.
